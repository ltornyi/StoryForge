# StoryForge

**StoryForge** is a Node.js API that transforms full-length articles into mobile-friendly story cards. Designed for content-rich applications, it helps automate the repackaging of articles into engaging visual narratives with minimal human effort.

## âœ¨ What It Does

StoryForge takes an article as input and returns an array of concise, structured "cards" that can be displayed in a story-like format in mobile apps.

- âœ… Smart segmentation into 4â€“8 cards
- âœ… First card always titled **"Top Line"**
- âœ… Last card always titled **"Bottom Line"**
- âœ… Intermediate cards may or may not have titles
- âœ… Each card has a meaningful, standalone snippet of the article
